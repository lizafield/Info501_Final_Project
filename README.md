# Info501_Final_Project

This is my Final Project for the Info501 class.  My app can be found at https://older-rural-populations.streamlit.app/ .

For this project, I've selected the World Health Organization's (WHO's) dataset on the percentage of older people aged 60 or over living in rural and urban areas.  To create the visualizations, I've only utilized the percentage of older people living in rural areas for the visualizations.

For more information, you can follow the link below to the WHO website.  The data can be found in the "Export Data" tab and methedologies can be found in the "Metadata" tab of the visualization platform.
