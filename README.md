# Info501_Final_Project

This is my Final Project for the Info501 class.  My app can be found at https://older-rural-populations.streamlit.app/ .

Abstract:
The World Health Organization deemed 2020-2030 "the decade of healthy ageing".  For older people, there are a number of disadvantages to living in a rural area, whether that be limited access to healthcare, transportation, support networks, or any other factor.   
As a part of the initiative, they've set about improving the quality of life for older people across the globe.  For my project, I've set up a dashboard to examine some areas of interest when it comes to the percentages of older populations living in rural areas.  

Data Description:
The data provided for this project was provided by the World Health Organization as a part of their healthy ageing initiative.  The data seperates out region, income, sex, age, and country.  The data is available at the following website under the "Export Data" tab. http://bit.ly/WHO-older-people

Algorithm Description/Tools Used: 
As this is an EDA project, no algorithms were used for this project.  I focused on a variety of graphs and visualizations utilizing plotly express, matplotlib, and the built in streamlit functionality.
